1. Step Into Greatness
Load up the Game: You see “Connect Wallet,” “Practice Offline,” “PLAY,” and “LEADERBOARD.” Kinda like my album tracklist, each option doin’ something major.
Choose Your Path and PLAY THE GAME:

Practice Offline if you just wanna perfect your shot. No wallet, no pressure—just up your hustle.
Connect Wallet if you’re ready to roll with the real players. I’m talkin’ about glory, top scores, maybe even that pot of gold.

2. Get That Shot Right
Aim & Release

On desktop, hold that mouse button like you’re holdin’ the mic—then pull back and let it go. On mobile, you tap and drag that ball. Put your finesse into it.
The farther you drag, the more power you unleash. Release that shot like you droppin’ the hottest verse of the year.
Scoreboard Shine

Every shot that rattles the net? That’s your score goin’ up. I’m talkin’ about rackin’ up points the same way I rack up Grammys.
Raw baby!

Watch the clock. It’s counting down your prime time. Once it hits zero, that’s a wrap, and your final score is locked. Be bold; greatness doesn’t wait.

3. Strategy Like a Genius
Master the Arc: A high arc is like a perfect hook on your track—some flair, some style, unstoppable.
Moderate Power: Not every shot needs max force. Learn that sweet release so you don’t overshoot.
Combos & Speed: After you let one fly, come right back. More shots, more points—like more bars, more hits.

4. Offline Vibes vs. Real-Stakes Mode
Practice Offline: No wallet needed. No fans, no record labels—just you and your training.
Connected Wallet: Might cost a little fee (like 0.01 SOL), but if you’re droppin’ heat, you can top that leaderboard and get real rewards. I’m talkin’ digital cheddar.

5. Game End & Leaderboard Glory
Time’s Up
When the clock says “done,” that’s your final. Take it or leave it, but hopefully you soared like Yeezus.
Check the Board
Hit “LEADERBOARD” to see who’s runnin’ the show. If you’re connected, you’ll see your name or wallet handle up there—aim for that top slot.
Reset Cycles
Some modes might restart every 36 hours or so. That means brand-new competition, brand-new shot at stardom.

6. If Something Ain’t Right
Shot Won’t Release?
Make sure you drag enough distance. Give the ball some space—like I need creative space.
Score Freeze?
Refresh or double-check your net. Don’t let a little lag hold you back from your next masterpiece.
Wallet Blues?
Make sure you’re on the correct Solana network. Reconnect if the system tries to front on you.
Game Lag?
Sometimes the spotlight’s too bright for older devices. Close unnecessary apps and let your phone breathe.

7. Rise & Shine
Practice.
Compete.
Dominate.
Watch the scoreboard, flex on the leaderboard, and hustle for that pot. This is Billion Dollar Ballin—play like a legend ‘cause there’s no point doin’ it any other way.
